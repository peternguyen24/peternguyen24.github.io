        <h1 id="What?">What?</h1><p>There are tons of time that I’m zero-motivated in my life.<br>Recent few weeks are strugling for me, since I feel like nothing is important for me to put effort into. Then, I decided to make a little research on the reason of less-motivated and find out the solution (for me). </p>
<p>Basically, motivation and enthusiasm is instance of desire and interest, and can be express by the driving force that push you to take action and pursue the target.<br>Most of people have their own desire and interest. Unluckily, they can get into the status of lacking motivation. The reason can be vary.</p>
<p>Let see the situation that one have a quite strong desire, strong interest, but still can’t put many effort to archive any goals in the field. That is not an comfortable feeling for one who experience this situation, and I guess not only me is in this squad, huh?</p>
<h1 id="Why?">Why?</h1><p>The reasons can be vary, but I choose 3 to think about</p>
<pre><code>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Desire</span>/interest/driving-force is <span class="keyword">not</span> strong enough.
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Laziness</span>
</span>-<span class="ruby"> <span class="constant">Lack</span> of faith, lack of <span class="keyword">self</span>-believe</span>
</code></pre><h1 id="HowToFix?">HowToFix?</h1><h3 id="1-_Desire/interest/drive-force_is_not_strong_enough-">1. Desire/interest/drive-force is not strong enough.</h3><p>This would be the most general reason.<br>Motivation are normally short burst. I start acting enthusiastically at that strong desire point, but quickly drop it at middle way. Difficulty, no time, no money, distraction,… too many things can pull our driving-force away. Day by day, I forget what make me start. </p>
<p>My thought is finding things that can tell me over and over about my dream. Keep dream the big dream is important, no dream, no party!</p>
<p>Drawing a diagram, progress picture (cute bar with rainbow unicorn, or whatever you like) might be a way to regain the interest that we drop. I bought instant stickers to draw and put them in the front of my desk. It helps me remind myself about what I’m looking for in life.</p>
<p>Generally, it works, but in certain points, I myself reject to look at those booster sticker. It was me too lasy to even care about it. </p>
<h3 id="2-_Laziness">2. Laziness</h3><p>No need to explain about this. It’s laziness, obviously. Everyone know it. </p>
<p>This is also the most annoying problem of me. It cause over-deadline submission, class skipping, very low-performance (mostly) on what I dont like (some subjects in Univ, for instance), etc.</p>
<p>I was thinking that boosting motivation can be solution for this. Now look at what I dont like, but essential/necessary? </p>
<p>Till now, I still havent found a super-effective solution for myseft. I believe I will be something around increasing self-comitment with minor task and chores. </p>
<h3 id="3-_Lack_of_faith,_lack_of_self-believe">3. Lack of faith, lack of self-believe</h3><p>In contrast of the first one, lack of faith, of self-confident is the obstacle that sits between me and me starting what I want. </p>
<p>Thinking is good, thinking too much about the difficulties isn’t. In other words, don’t fear.<br>Innocent is good. Taking off my mind problems and difficulties and going with my guts on achieving the goals usually result a higher performance. I find myself doing my job with the fool and hunger better. Steve was right! (hehe)</p>
<h1 id="Then">Then</h1><p>All over the above, the best in my opinions is keep fighting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dont avoid small things. </li>
<li>Face the difficulties</li>
<li>Challenge myself</li>
<li>Take enough exercises.</li>
</ul>
